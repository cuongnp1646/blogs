# JS-ES6

- JS has dynamic types.This means that same variable can be used to hold different data types.

```javascript
  let x = 5;
      x = `javascript is sexy!`;
```

- Do not declare Strings, Numbers, and Booleans as Objects! It slowdown   execution speed.

```javascript
  const str = 'Chuc mung sinh nhat!';
  const cmnm = new String ('Chuc mung nam moi');
```

## This

- The Javascript `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used:
  - In method, `this` refers to the ***owner object***.

  - Alone, `this` refers to the **global object**.

  - In a function, `this` refers to the **global object**

  - In a function, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined`.

  - In an event, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event.

  - Methods like `call()`, `apply()`, can refer `this` to **any object**.

- Let the above:
  - `this` in a Method:

  ```javascript
    const person = {
      firstName: 'SUN',
      lastName: 'Asterisk',
      fullName: function () { // don't define this with arrow style :D
        return this.firstName + "-" + this.lastName;
      }
    }
  ```

  - JS is a scripting language which means that there is no compilation step in code execution. Interpreter reads the code and executes it line by line. `The enviroment (or scope)` in which the line is being excuted is know as `Excution Context`. JS runtime maintains a stack of these execution contexts and the execution context present at the top of this stack is currently being excuted. The object that `this` refers changes every time execution context is changed.
  
  - `this` refers to global object
  
  ```javascript
   this.me = 'Phuc';
   function foo() {
     console.log("Simple function call");
     console.log(this === window);
     console.log(this.me);
   }

   foo(); // prints true on the console
  ```

  - But if `strict mode` is enabled for any function then the value of `this` will be `undefined` as in strict mode, global object refers to undefiend in place of windows object.

  ```javascript
    function foo() {
      'use strict';
      console.log('Simple function call');
      console.log(this);
    }
    foo(); // prints `undefined` as in `strict mode` value of `this` is undefined.
  ```

  - `this` refers to new instance

  ```javascript
    function Person (fn, ln) {
      this.firstName = fn;
      this.lastName = ln;

      this.displayName = function () {
        console.log(`Name: ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`);
      }
    }

    let personOne = new Person('One', 'Mr');
    personOne.displayName(); // prints name Mr One
    let personTwo = new Person('Two', 'Ms');
    personTwo.displayName(); // prints Ms Two
  ```

  - `this` refers to invoker object ( parent object)
